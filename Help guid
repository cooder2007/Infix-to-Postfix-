//////---------- Required Tools ----------//////

Before running any program, make sure you have:

VS Code installed

A compiler for thet Program installed installed

The extension installed in VS Code

🔹 Installing VS Code

Download and install VS Code from the official website:

👉 https://code.visualstudio.com/

I will disscus about the copiler in specific heading for the program.
This works for Windows, Linux, and macOS.


//////---------- Now for C/C++ ----------//////

Running C/C++ Programs Using VS Code

(Windows, Linux, and macOS)

This guide assumes that you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to write and run all programs in this repository.
This could even run in any other folder But I am specific to my repository.

🛠️ Required Tools

Before running any C++ program, make sure you have:

VS Code installed 

(You can use Dev-C++ if you are a beginner.
It comes with a built-in compiler. 
U can just open the file in Dev-C++.
Press F11 it will compile and run the program for U)

A C++ compiler (g++) installed (For C you could install gcc)

The C/C++ extension installed in VS Code

🔹 Installing the C/C++ Extension in VS Code

Open VS Code

Go to the Extensions tab (Ctrl + Shift + X)

Search for C/C++

Install the extension by Microsoft

This extension provides IntelliSense, debugging, and compiler support.

🔹 Installing a C++ Compiler (g++)
✅ Windows Users

You need to install a compiler such as MinGW or MSYS2.

Recommended option: MSYS2   (This will aslo Install The gcc if not U can now install )
👉 https://www.msys2.org/

After installation:

Install gcc using MSYS2

Make sure g++ is added to your PATH

You may also use Dev-C++ if you are a beginner, as it comes with a built-in compiler.

✅ Linux Users

Most Linux distributions already include or support g++.

Install it using your package manager:

Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++


Fedora

sudo dnf install gcc-c++

✅ macOS Users

Install Xcode Command Line Tools by running:

xcode-select --install


This installs clang, which works the same way as g++.

🔹 Checking if the Compiler Is Installed

Open the terminal in VS Code using:

Ctrl + `


Then run:

g++ --version


If you see output similar to this:

g++ (GCC) 13.2.0


or

Apple clang version 15.0.0


then your compiler is installed correctly.

If the command is not recognized, the compiler is either not installed or not added to PATH.

🔹 Compiling a C++ Program

Navigate to the folder containing your .cpp file.

Use the following command to compile:

g++ fileName.cpp -o fileName

Example:

If your file name is by.cpp:

g++ by.cpp -o by  
(For C program write gcc instead of g++)


This command:

Compiles the source file

Creates an executable file

⚠️ C++ programs must be compiled before they can be executed.

🔹 Running the Program
🪟 Windows (PowerShell / CMD)
.\fileName


Example:

.\by

🐧 Linux / 🍎 macOS / Git Bash
./fileName


Example:

./by


This will execute the compiled program.

📝 Important Notes

The file name and executable name must match

Always recompile the program after making changes

Compilation errors must be fixed before running the program

File names are case-sensitive on Linux and macOS

✅ Summary

Install VS Code

Install a C++ compiler (g++)

Install the C/C++ extension

Check compiler using g++ --version  (Enter gcc for C programs )

Compile using g++ file.cpp -o file  (Enter gcc for C programs )

Run the executable using ./file or .\file
