//////---------- Required Tools ----------//////

Before running any program, make sure you have:

VS Code installed

A compiler for thet Program installed installed

The extension installed in VS Code

🔹 Installing VS Code

Download and install VS Code from the official website:

👉 https://code.visualstudio.com/

I will disscus about the copiler in specific heading for the program.
This works for Windows, Linux, and macOS.


//////---------- Now for C/C++ ----------//////

Running C/C++ Programs Using VS Code

(Windows, Linux, and macOS)

This guide assumes that you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to write and run all programs in this repository.
This could even run in any other folder But I am specific to my repository.

🛠️ Required Tools

Before running any C++ program, make sure you have:

VS Code installed 

(You can use Dev-C++ if you are a beginner.
It comes with a built-in compiler. 
U can just open the file in Dev-C++.
Press F11 it will compile and run the program for U)

A C++ compiler (g++) installed (For C you could install gcc)

The C/C++ extension installed in VS Code

🔹 Installing the C/C++ Extension in VS Code

Open VS Code

Go to the Extensions tab (Ctrl + Shift + X)

Search for C/C++

Install the extension by Microsoft

This extension provides IntelliSense, debugging, and compiler support.

🔹 Installing a C++ Compiler (g++)
✅ Windows Users

You need to install a compiler such as MinGW or MSYS2.

Recommended option: MSYS2   (This will aslo Install The gcc if not U can now install )
👉 https://www.msys2.org/

After installation:

Install gcc using MSYS2

Make sure g++ is added to your PATH

You may also use Dev-C++ if you are a beginner, as it comes with a built-in compiler.

✅ Linux Users

Most Linux distributions already include or support g++.

Install it using your package manager:

Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++


Fedora

sudo dnf install gcc-c++

✅ macOS Users

Install Xcode Command Line Tools by running:

xcode-select --install


This installs clang, which works the same way as g++.

🔹 Checking if the Compiler Is Installed

Open the terminal in VS Code using:

Ctrl + `


Then run:

g++ --version


If you see output similar to this:

g++ (GCC) 13.2.0


or

Apple clang version 15.0.0


then your compiler is installed correctly.

If the command is not recognized, the compiler is either not installed or not added to PATH.

🔹 Compiling a C++ Program

Navigate to the folder containing your .cpp file.

Use the following command to compile:

g++ fileName.cpp -o fileName

Example:

If your file name is by.cpp:

g++ by.cpp -o by  
(For C program write gcc instead of g++)


This command:

Compiles the source file

Creates an executable file

⚠️ C++ programs must be compiled before they can be executed.

🔹 Running the Program
🪟 Windows (PowerShell / CMD)
.\fileName


Example:

.\by

🐧 Linux / 🍎 macOS / Git Bash
./fileName


Example:

./by


This will execute the compiled program.

📝 Important Notes

The file name and executable name must match

Always recompile the program after making changes

Compilation errors must be fixed before running the program

File names are case-sensitive on Linux and macOS

✅ Summary

Install VS Code

Install a C++ compiler (g++)

Install the C/C++ extension

Check compiler using g++ --version  (Enter gcc for C programs )

Compile using g++ file.cpp -o file  (Enter gcc for C programs )

Run the executable using ./file or .\file

//////---------- Now for Java ----------//////

Running Java Programs Using VS Code 
(Use BlueJ if U are begner to )

(Windows, Linux, and macOS)

This guide assumes that you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to write and run all programs in this repository.
This could even run in any other folder But I am specific to my repository.

🛠️ Required Tools

Installing the Java Extension in VS Code

Open VS Code

Go to the Extensions tab (Ctrl + Shift + X)

Search for Java Extension Pack

Install the extension by Microsoft

This extension provides:

IntelliSense

Debugging

Maven/Gradle support

Code navigation

🔹 Installing Java (JDK)

✅ Windows Users

You need to install a JDK (Java Development Kit).

Recommended option: OpenJDK

👉 https://adoptium.net/

Steps:

Download and install the latest LTS version

During installation, make sure Add Java to PATH is checked

✅ Linux Users

Install OpenJDK using your package manager:

Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk


Fedora

sudo dnf install java-17-openjdk-devel


✅ macOS Users

Install using Homebrew:

brew install openjdk


Or install directly from:
👉 https://adoptium.net/

🔹 Checking if Java Is Installed

Open the terminal in VS Code using:

Ctrl + `

Then run:

java --version


or

javac --version


If you see output like:

openjdk 17.0.9


then Java is installed correctly.

If the command is not recognized, Java is either not installed or not added to PATH.

🔹 Compiling a Java Program

Navigate to the folder containing your .java file.

Use the following command:

javac FileName.java


Example:

If your file name is By.java:

javac By.java


This command:

Compiles the source file

Creates a .class file

⚠️ Java programs must be compiled before they can be executed.

🔹 Running the Program

🪟 Windows / 🐧 Linux / 🍎 macOS

Use:

java FileName


Example:

java By


⚠️ Do NOT write .class while running.

📝 Important Notes

File name must match the class name

Java is case-sensitive

Always recompile after making changes

Compilation errors must be fixed before running

main() method is required to run a Java program

✅ Summary

Install VS Code

Install Java JDK

Install Java Extension Pack

Check Java using java --version or javac --version

Compile using javac File.java

Run using java File


//////---------- Now for Python ----------//////

Before running any Python program, make sure you have:
